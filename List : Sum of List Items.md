## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **sum of all elements** in a list.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm

items=[153,147,124,102]
print(sum(items))

```

## Output
![438588168-66305d32-3488-42d3-a8ba-0f37998fc3e6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32100ab2-d39f-4d07-8191-b85d6ca4c336)
